# Automated Testing Summary (150 words)

The Selenium script automates login testing for `saucedemo.com`, verifying valid (`standard_user`, `secret_sauce`) and invalid (`invalid_user`, `wrong_password`) credentials. Results showed 100% success: valid login redirected to the inventory page, and invalid login displayed an error message. Screenshots (attached in report) confirm outcomes.

AI-enhanced tools like Testim.io improve test coverage by generating additional test cases based on user behavior patterns, reducing manual script writing. For example, Testimâ€™s AI can detect UI changes and auto-update selectors, preventing test failures due to DOM updates. Compared to manual testing, AI automation is faster (tests ran in ~5 seconds vs. minutes manually) and scales to cover edge cases (e.g., empty inputs). However, AI may miss context-specific bugs, requiring human oversight. Selenium with AI plugins balances speed and reliability, making it ideal for regression testing in agile environments.
