# AI-Powered Documentation Generator Proposal

**Purpose**:  
The AI Documentation Generator automates the creation of technical documentation (e.g., API docs, user guides) from source code and commit messages, addressing the time-consuming nature of manual documentation.

**Workflow**:  
1. **Code Parsing**: The tool uses NLP models (e.g., CodeBERT) to extract function signatures, comments, and logic from codebases.  
2. **Context Analysis**: It analyzes commit messages and issue trackers (e.g., GitHub Issues) to infer feature descriptions and usage.  
3. **Doc Generation**: A fine-tuned LLM (e.g., GPT-4) generates markdown files with sections like “Overview,” “Endpoints,” and “Examples.”  
4. **Validation**: Developers review and edit via a web interface, with AI suggesting improvements.  

**Impact**:  
- **Time Savings**: Reduces documentation time by 50%, allowing developers to focus on coding.  
- **Consistency**: Ensures uniform style across projects.  
- **Accessibility**: Auto-generates user-friendly guides, improving adoption.  

This tool enhances productivity and maintains high-quality documentation in fast-paced development cycles.
